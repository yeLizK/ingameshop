# ingameshop

Hello!

This is my Mastered Bootcamp Live Creator Challenge#3 Project. In this live challenge we were required to create an in-game shop in apprx. 6 hours.

At the beginning of the challenge, while creating a new project, I got some Unity compile errors which apparently was a result of a C: Drive failure. Unfortunately I could
not use my own computer but borrowed another computer at home. I had to install every software that I needed to that computer. When I am ready to go, I already lost 3 hours.
Instead of doing everything from scratch, I converted my current project's character configurator into an in-game shop. This saved me a lot of time.

I am really happy with the final result, since I met the minimum requirements at the end.
